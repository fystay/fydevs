            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <p>
              When you send a message or a project brief, we collect the details you enter: your name, email address,
              optional business name, and the content of your message or brief. We don&apos;t ask for more than we need
              to reply.
            </p>

            <h2>How we use it</h2>
            <p>
              We use these details only to respond to your enquiry, prepare an estimate or proposal you&apos;ve asked
              for, and keep a record of our correspondence. We don&apos;t sell your information or use it for unrelated
              marketing.
            </p>

            <h2>How it&apos;s delivered</h2>
            <p>
              Submissions are sent from our website to our business inbox using a transactional email provider, which
              processes the message on our behalf in order to deliver it.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookies and storage</h2>
            <p>
              This website doesn&apos;t set cookies and doesn&apos;t use analytics or advertising trackers. The website
              configurator saves your answers in your own browser&apos;s local storage so you don&apos;t lose progress;
              this stays on your device and is removed when you send your brief or clear your browser data.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the homepage you can choose &ldquo;Try it live&rdquo; to load a client&apos;s website inside a preview
              window. Nothing is loaded from that site until you choose to, and once loaded it is governed by that
              site&apos;s own privacy and cookie policy.
            </p>

            <h2>How long we keep it</h2>
            <p>
              We keep enquiry correspondence for as long as needed to deal with your enquiry and any work that follows,
              and then delete it unless we have a legal reason to retain it.
            </p>

            <h2>Your rights</h2>
            <p>
              You can ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you, ask us to correct or delete it, or object
              to how we use it. To do so, <Link href="/contact?topic=other">contact us</Link>. If you&apos;re unhappy
              with how we&apos;ve handled your information, you can complain to the Information Commissioner&apos;s
              Office (ICO).
